## Installation

Follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .env
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   source .env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages** within the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

4. **Run your script**. While the virtual environment is active, all `pip` installs and `python` commands will apply to this isolated environment.

5. **Deactivate** the virtual environment when done:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
